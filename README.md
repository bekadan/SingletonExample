Singleton Design Pattern in C# (.NET 8)

This repository demonstrates the Singleton Design Pattern in C#, using both a thread-unsafe and a thread-safe (Lazy<T>) implementation.
The project simulates a configuration manager that loads application settings from a JSON file and is shared across multiple services and threads.

ðŸš¨ Problem

Without Singleton, multiple parts of an application may:

Create multiple configuration objects.

Reload configuration files many times (performance hit).

End up with inconsistent settings.

This repo shows how that problem appears in multi-threaded scenarios and how to solve it with a thread-safe Singleton.

âœ… Solution

We implement a Singleton ConfigManager class:

Loads configuration once from appsettings.json.

Provides global access to settings through ConfigManager.Instance.

Uses Lazy<T> to ensure thread-safe initialization.

âš¡ How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/ComplexSingletonExample.git
cd ComplexSingletonExample


Make sure you have .NET 8 SDK installed:

dotnet --version


Run the application:

dotnet run

ðŸ”‘ Key Learnings

Difference between thread-unsafe and thread-safe Singletons.

How to use Lazy<T> for safe lazy initialization in .NET.

Real-world application of Singleton in configuration management.

How multiple services (UserService, OrderService, EmailService) can share the same configuration.

ðŸš€ Next Steps

Extend this project to an ASP.NET Core 8 Web API, injecting ConfigManager into controllers.

Compare Singleton with other creational patterns (Factory, Builder, Dependency Injection).

Add unit tests to verify Singleton behavior under concurrent conditions.
